![Challenges](ProgChal.png)

Done - 38, 46, 52, 53, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 63, 64, 66, 68, 104, 111, 113, 127
WIP - 10, 47, 71 116, 125

NOTE: 47 isn't in DONE because the python is from wikipedia. I hope to recreate it myself but I refuse to plagiarize.
      43 has two solutions. The python one is recursive and, in my opinion, more elegant
      104 can't check for a loss but that's not critical for an MVP so I don't mind
      71 involves building my own roguelike (heck yeah) so will be more complicated than initally thought
      125 involves checking for mate and currently having an undraw issue
